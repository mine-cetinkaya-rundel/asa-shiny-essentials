# Shiny Essentials
## ASA Traveling Course 2020

## Description

Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight  from R. You can host standalone apps on a webpage or embed them in R Markdown  documents or build dashboards. This short course will introduce you to the  basics of building web applications with Shiny, essentials of reactive  programming, and how to customize and deploy your apps for others to use.

## Workshop setup

We will use RStudio Cloud for the workshop so you don't need to install anything ahead of time. I recommend using either Google Chrome or Firefox as your browser. We will regularly break for small group activities so please be ready to work through hands on exercises with others in the workshop. It would be useful if you're able to keep your video and mic on at least during the breakout groups. I will ask that you keep yourself muted during the main session and put any questions in the chat window. If you're able to do so, I encourage you to keep your video on during the main session as well, but this is entirely optional.

## Instructor

Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel is Senior Lecturer in the School of Mathematics at University of Edinburgh and Data Scientist and Professional Educator at RStudio. She is on leave from her Associate Professor of the Practice position at the Department of Statistical Science at Duke University. Mine’s work focuses on innovation in statistics and data science pedagogy, with an emphasis on computing, reproducible research, student-centered learning, and open-source education as well as pedagogical approaches for enhancing retention of women and under-represented minorities in STEM. Mine works on integrating computation into the undergraduate statistics curriculum, using reproducible research methodologies and analysis of real and complex datasets. She also organizes ASA DataFest, an annual two-day competition in which teams of undergraduate students work to reveal insights into a rich and complex data set. Mine works on the OpenIntro project, whose mission is to make educational products that are free, transparent, and lower barriers to education. As part of this project she co-authored three open-source introductory statistics textbooks. She is also the creator and maintainer of datasciencebox.org and she teaches the popular Statistics with R MOOC on Coursera.
